HackerSchool
============
This file contains a wide variety of small projects and tutorials from Hacker School (not a complete list).

<h4>Tic Tac Toe</h4>
<strong>Final_tictactoe.py</strong><br/>
This was my first Hacker School project! This Tic Tac Toe game uses the mini-max algorithm and is written in python.
The algorithm works and I learned a ton about recursion. The actual game needs more work before it can be played.

<h4>Sockets</h4>
<strong>sockets.py</strong><br/>
Part of a tutorial led by Tom on web sockets

<h4>Chat Server</h4>
<strong>chat_server.py</strong>
My first chat server!

<h4>Tutorials</h4>
Ocaml<br/>
Python Essential<br/>
Twisted<br/>
